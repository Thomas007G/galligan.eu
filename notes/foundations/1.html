    <h1>An <em>Algorithm</em> is a set of instructions which state how a task is to be performed</h1>
    <h2 id="al-khwarizmi----origin-of-term-%22algorithm%22">Al-Khwarizmi --&gt; Origin of term &quot;Algorithm&quot;</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>An <em>algorithm</em> is an <em>ordered</em>, <em>deterministic</em>, <em>terminating</em> set of instructions</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="ordered">Ordered</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Must be in correct order, otherwise algorithm does not make sense</li>
      <li>An example is long division<ul>
        <li>Divide</li>
        <li>Subtract</li>
        <li>Carry Down</li>
        <li>When no more numbers to carry down, the answer is the number above the line</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The algorithm wouldn't work if the order was switched</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Deterministic</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Instructions must be clear, unambiguous and deterministic forwhoever or whatever is going to interpret them<ul>
        <li>A computer cannot compute &quot;common-sense&quot;</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&quot;There is a man knocked down every 2 minutes&quot; --&gt; ambiguous, as it could relate to any man in the world, or a specific man, who gets knocked down constantly.</p>
    <h2>Executable</h2>
    <ul>
    <li>Are the instructions possible to carry out?</li>
    </ul>
    <code>
      Float up the steps /* impossible, as a human cannot carry out this instruction */
    </code>
    <h2>Terminating</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>An algorithm must have an end... but this isn't always the case... so the definition is obsolete(?)</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 >Programming is mostly about algorithms, so you're better off getting used to them sooner rather than later.</h1>
