  <h1>Systems Organisation</h1>
  <h2>How computers work:</h2>
  <p>Computers are fundamentally a series of logic gates that perform binary calculations</p>
  <p>These calculations are performed 1000000000's of times per second. This is caused mainly, in part due to the simplicity of the calculations performed by the logic gates in the cpu</p>
  <p>To allow for humans to interact with these logic machines, these machines are used to emulate many systems through the use of virtual machines.</p>
  <h4>Virtual Machines</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>No physical hardware <b>directly</b> interacts with these virtual machines (hence; virtual)</li>
    <li>Run information through many layers of abstraction through these virtual machines</li>
    <li>They allow for higher levels of use, allowing for humans to interact with computers after multiple layers of these virtual machines</li>
  </ul>
  <h4>Software</h4>
  <ul>
    <li>Programs like C, C++, Java and python are High-Level-Languages, which allows humans to use the computer to allow other humans to interact with the computer.</li>
    <li>These high-level languages interact with lower-level languages like Assembly Code</li>
  </ul>
